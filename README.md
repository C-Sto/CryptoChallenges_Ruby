# CryptoChallenges_Ruby

My repo for the cryptopals challenges offered by Matasano at http://cryptopals.com/

The main file just points at which challenge to run, handy for testing.
Eventually I'll make them all pretty - and explain what is going on within the challenge, but I'll try to get them all completed first.
